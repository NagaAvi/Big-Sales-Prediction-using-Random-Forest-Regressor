# Big-Sales-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Regressor

## Objective

The objective of the project is to gather sales data and prepare it for analysis by identifying relevant factors which will influence the sales. We will be using Random Forest Regressor model to learn the patterns from the data, model's performance and accuracy and predict sales for future scenarios.

##Data Source

The Source of the data is the GitHub Dataset of YBI Foundation
There are 12 variables in dataset.

Item_Identifier
Item_Weight
Item_Fat_Content
Item_Visibility
Item_Type
Item_MRP
Outlet_Identifier
Outlet_Establishment_Year
Outlet_Size
Outlet_Location_Type
Outlet_Type
Item_Outlet_Sales

##Explanation

This project os to know what effects the sales like, why do sales grow up or down? This project pridict the future sales. The project checked how close the predictions were to the actual sales numbers. The model achieved an R-squared score of approximately 0.51, indicating moderate predictive performance.
